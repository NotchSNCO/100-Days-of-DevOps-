🚀 100 Days of DevOps: Mission Log
Target: Master the Stack. Status: Day 16 & Counting. 🎖️
Welcome to my journey! I’m a USAF Veteran turned Systems Explorer, documenting 100 consecutive days of breaking things and putting them back together (better). This repo is a live-feed of my technical evolution from Linux basics to Cloud-Native Orchestration.

🛠️ The Mission Phases
🛰️ Phase 1: Linux & Networking (Days 1-20)
Status: 🟢 Mission Active

"In space, no one can hear your sudo scream."

Day 1-5: The Gatekeepers 🛡️
Day 1: Set up non-interactive shells (keeping the bots out).

Day 2: User accounts with expiration dates (temporary passes only!).

Day 3: Locked down Root SSH. If you aren't on the list, you aren't getting in.

Day 4-5: Mastered file permissions and got cozy with SELinux configuration.

Day 6-10: Automation & Repairs 🔧
Day 6: My first Cron Job. The server now works while I sleep.

Day 8: Bootstrapped Ansible. Why do it once when you can automate it?

Day 9: MariaDB Troubleshooting. Found the ghost in the machine and fixed it.

Day 11-16: The Web Tier 🌐
Day 11: Deployed Tomcat. Middleware is officially in the building.

Day 13-14: Firewall gymnastics with IPtables and hunting down zombie processes.

Day 15-16: The Big One. Set up Nginx with SSL certificates and configured it as a Load Balancer. Traffic is now balanced and encrypted. 🔒

<details> <summary><b>Planned Tasks</b></summary>

Day 21-30: Git-fu (Branching, Merging, and the occasional git reset --hard prayer).

Day 35-40: Dockerizing everything. Containers are the future, and I'm the captain now.
