🚀 100 Days of DevOps: Mission Log
Target: Master the Stack. Status: Day 16 & Counting. 🎖️
Welcome to my journey! I’m a USAF Veteran turned Systems Explorer, documenting 100 consecutive days of breaking things and putting them back together (better). This repo is a live-feed of my technical evolution from Linux basics to Cloud-Native Orchestration.

Day 0: The "Why" Before the "How" 🛫 ➡️ 💻
Log Date: December 28, 2025

Current Status: Retired from the Skies, Entering the Cloud.

After 20 years in the U.S. Air Force, I’ve handled high-stakes missions, managed complex systems, and learned that "good enough" usually isn't. When I retired in 2018, I realized the tech world is just another theater of operations—only here, the "enemy" is a 404 error, and my "fleet" consists of Nginx servers and MariaDB clusters.

Why am I doing this?

Discipline is a Muscle: You don't stay in the Air Force for two decades without loving a good routine. 100 days of code is just a new type of basic training.

The Entrepreneurial Bug: I’m building an online business, and I refuse to pay someone else to fix a server I can learn to master myself.

Manifesting Reality: I meditate and recite affirmations daily. Today’s affirmation: "My code shall compile, and my load balancer shall actually balance."

I’m starting at the CLI and aiming for the Cloud. If you see me talking to my terminal, don't worry—we’re just having a "briefing."
